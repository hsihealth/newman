# `Newman::Mailer` allows you to easily receive mail via IMAP and send mail via
# SMTP, and is the default mailing strategy used by `Newman::Server.simple`.
# This class mostly exists to serve as an adapter that bridges the gap between
# the mail gem and Newman's configuration system. 
#
# `Newman::Mailer`'s interface is minimal by design so that other objects
# can easily stand in for it as long as they respond to the same set of
# messages. Be sure to see `Newman::TestMailer` for an example of how to build a
# custom object that can be used in place of a `Newman::Mailer` object.
#
#
# `Newman::Mailer` is part of Newman's **internal interface**.

    # ---
    
    # To initialize a `Newman::Mailer` object, a settings object must be
    # provided, i.e:
    #
    #     settings = Newman::Settings.from_file('config/environment.rb')
    #     mailer   = Newman::Mailer.new(settings)
    #
    # This is done automatically for you by `Newman::Server.simple`, but must be
    # done manually if you are creating a `Newman::Server` instance from
    # scratch.
    #
    # Currently, not all of the settings supported by the mail gem are mapped by
    # Newman. This is by design, to limit the amount of configuration options
    # need to think about. However, if this is causing you a problem, 
    # please [file an issue](https://github.com/mendicant-university/newman/issues).
